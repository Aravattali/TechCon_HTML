            <h2>Past Speakers</h2>
            <p>A well-crafted speaker bio is key to presenting and introducing yourself to the world. This is where you can give a glimpse into your story while also building your personal brand, attracting clients, and establishing your credibility as a
                professional speaker. It’s not just about your message but it tells why you and your story are so well-suited to provide the message. This article will guide you on how to write an effective speaker bio and will provide top-notch bios
                to inspire you in writing your own. Let’s get into it!</p>

            <p>I shouldn’t have to write this. Obviously, your bio should give your name, your industry, and any titles you have. This clearly states who you are, what you do, and what you’re all about. The reader needs and wants this context to understand
                who you really are. Having this at the outset of your bio creates that strong first impression we talked about earlier.</p>
